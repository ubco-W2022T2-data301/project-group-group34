# Project Vision

Sixty five million years ago, an asteroid with a diameter of at least ten kilometers crashed into the Earth near what is now the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico. The impact flung tonnes of material into the earth that heated up during reentry, heating the atmosphere and causing a rain of hot material onto the surface. The impact caused dust from the crater to envelop the entirety of the planet, as well as causing widespread powerful earthquakes across the planet.

This event, known to history as the Chicxulub Event, wiped out three quarters of all life on Earth, marking the end of the dominance of non-avian dinosaurs. An event similar to this can happen again. Asteroid impacts of this magnitude are an **existential** threat to humanity, and imperative that to be aware of any potential asteroids that might collide with our planet. 

We can do this by looking for Near Earth Asteroids, and tracking their orbits. We can then use this information to predict if they will collide with the Earth, and if possible, redirect the asteroid or prepare for impact. Doing so will save extant species from extinction, including our own. 

# Aims
Our project aims to analyze known Near Earth Asteroids, and infer data about them such as orbit trajectories, likelihood of impact, and position within the wider solar system. We believe that doing so may yield insight into the location, distribution, and potential risk to Earth of Near Earth Asteroids.
