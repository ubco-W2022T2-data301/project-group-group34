# Project Vision

Culture is dynamic, it builds itself on the past and reacts to trends in the present. It manifests itself through music, art, fashion, architecture, and language among other things. Forms of cultural expression, and trends therein, can often be indicative of the time period they existed in. Photographs, snapshots of a place or people at any given moment can unintentionally date themselves; this can be due to the types of clothes that the people in it wear, or the styles of architecture of the buildings in it. 

In this sense, a textual work is not too dissimilar to a photograph. Much like how certain fashions or architectural styles increase or decrease in popularity, words increase or decrease in use. By comparing the frequency of words in a long enough text to a broader dataset of word frequency throughout the years, we hope to be able to reasonably identify the time period in which the text was written. We believe that doing so will grant us a greater understanding and appreciation of the evolution of language.

# Aims
We aim to develop a machine learning model that estimates the date of authorship of an input text based on its word frequency, compared against a large dataset of word frequencies and their distribution throughout the years.
