## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Collectively we all have varying interests in using this data set. Although a few recurring themes in working with this specific data set are: seeing how writing styles have collectively changed or stayed the same over a longer period of time, creating an inference model that tries to date undated texts, and exploring the possibility of how we could use this data to estimate what year different pieces of work have been written in based on word frequencies. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set consists of the 1-grams from the English section in Google Book Ngram Corpus and the entire Open american National Corpus. These data collections contain both formal and informal means of communication, such as fiction and non-fiction books, journals, letters and more. The google ngram data set contains individual words, the number of times they appear and the year they appeared in, whereas the OANC data set contains the entire text of the documents with the publication date, however, the data is quite messy, so it will take some work to clean it up.
