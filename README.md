## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

    A collective topic of interest for this using this data set is to look how size and shape can effect the earth when it come into contact with out atmosphere. We each have drawn out own reasoning based on a collective goal; for example, Ben will be looking closely at how the sizes and impacts of asteroids can have varying levels for potential damage upon entering earths atmosphere. Whereas, I (Brianna) am interested in looking into the collisons of asteroids that enter the proximitiy of the earth and suns atosphere based on average velocity and size measurements. Lastly Ankkit is looking closely at the relationship between orbits and magnitudes of asteroids used MIOD.
