## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Collectively we all have varying interests in using this data set. Some of us want to study the orbits of asteroids, and some of us want to study the damage they might want to cause. However, there exists a consensus among the members of this group that Near Earth Asteroids pose a serious threat to humanity, and that studying them is a possible method to reduce this threat.

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our dataset contains of three files one containing information about the orbits of Near Earth Asteroids, one containing the velocity, diameter, and impact probability of asteroids, and finally one containing close approaches that the asteroids have had to Earth. All the data is collected from NASA's [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nasa/asteroid-impacts) page and their own [Center for Near Eart Object Studies (CENOS)](https://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca/) webpage.
