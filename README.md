## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words

Collectively we all have varying interests in using this data set. Although a few recurring themes in working with this specific data set are, seeing how writing styles have collectively changed or stayed the same over a longer period of time, to create an inference model that uses undated texts and produces a specific date that corresponds to the when it was originally written, and the possibility of how we can use this data to estimate what year different pieces of work have been published based on word frequencies. 

## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Our data set is pulling from 1-grams from the English section in Google Book Ngram Corpus and from Open american National Corpus. We are planning to look through both data collections for formal and informal means of communication, some example are but not limited to, words such as “hello”, or phrases such as “how are you”. From those key phrases we will begin to date back how many years or decades was that term or phrase was used.
